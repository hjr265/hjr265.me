Just a few hours ago I didn't even know that I would suddenly have the urge to write. Heck! I didn't even know that I would be creating a blog for that. But now that my first post is live, I guess I will have to make it a habit.

The first post is definitely about saying "hello". And I thought, what better way is there to say that than to say it in different languages: [Bash](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157156), [C](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157098), [C#](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157194), [C++](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157105), [Go](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157113), [Java](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157190), [JavaScript](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157127), [Perl](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157164), [PHP](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157146), [Python](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157172), [VisualBasic](https://gist.github.com/hjr265/8157179)

You don't speak them? Well, I plan to learn more very soon :-)
