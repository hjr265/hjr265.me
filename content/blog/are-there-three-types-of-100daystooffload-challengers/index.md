A couple of weeks ago, I wrote [my second #100DaysToOffload milestone blog post](/blog/100daystooffload-milestone-67th-blog-post/).

I mentioned how I feel like a remnant characteristic of my days in the university has played a role in taking this challenge. I have been writing more frequently as I am nearing the end of the challenge.

It got me wondering: are there three types of #100DaysToOffload challengers?

I took a quick look at some of the recent entries in the [hall of fame](https://100daystooffload.com/#-hall-of-fame-) and analyzed how the publication dates of the blog posts were spread out over a year of the challenge by these other challengers.

I wrote a small and quick Go program that generates blog activity charts which visualize the 365 days of the challenge for entries in the Hall of Fame.

Then, I picked 15 entries semi-randomly from the Hall of Fame and generated charts for those entries. I am identifying the entries in the image caption by their completion date only.

The blue lines on each of these images indicate the publication date of the blog posts. Each image represents a total of 365 days.

Do you see any pattern?

No? Um, okay.

I mentioned in my last milestone blog post that I wrote blog posts more frequently between the 1st and the 2nd milestones than I did before the 1st one.

If I were to draw a chart of [my #100DaysToOffload blog posts](/tags/100daystooffload/), the lines, I imagine, would lean more to the right. ðŸ˜…
