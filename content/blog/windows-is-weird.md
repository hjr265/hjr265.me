I know we could list a thousand reasons why Windows is weird. But this particular reason is my favourite.

Here are the N steps to my favourite Windows 10 weirdness:

1. Copy the URL to this blog post.

    ``` txt {linenos=false}
    https://hjr265.me/blog/windows-is-weird/
    ```

2. Paste the URL in a Notepad window. You see the entire URL to this blog post. Good.

3. Open File Explorer. Right-click on an empty area in the window. Click on `New â€º Folder`. Paste the URL as the name of the folder.

    ``` txt {linenos=false}
    httpshjr265.meblogwindows-is-weird
    ```

    File Explorer takes the URL and strips all invalid characters before using it as the folder name. Smart.

4. Paste the URL in a Notepad window again.

What do you see?

Windows is weird.
