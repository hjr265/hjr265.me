## What is #100DaysToOffload?

[#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) is an Internet challenge created by Kev Quirk.

I don't quite recall how I came across this challenge, probably through a front-page entry on Hacker News. But, I am glad I did.

The goal of this challenge is simple: To encourage you to write.

> The whole point of #100DaysToOffload is to challenge you to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year. [\[...\]](https://100daystooffload.com/)

The Internet has a million reasons for why you should write, and write regularly. But, for me it is simple: I am grateful I can write.

Human beings are unique. Animals have their ways of communicating with their peers. But, humans stand out. Look at the centuries of progress and development humans have made.

Imagine if humans didn't have the power of language and if humans couldn't write.

## What were the first 33 of #100DaysToOffload blog posts about?

Almost all of my first 33 posts were about technical stuff: programming tutorials, software tricks, etc. There was one rant in [disguise of a post](/blog/spam-story-a-not-quite-ethical-hacker/).

Some of these posts did pretty well on the Internet.

- [Simple Fixed-window Rate Limiter With Redis](/blog/simple-rate-limiter-with-redis) got picked up by some programming newsletters and gained a lot of traction.
- [Go Tidbit: Handling Signals, Exiting Gracefully](/blog/go-tidbit-handling-signals-exitting-gracefully) was also picked up by some newsletters and has done quite well.
- [Making Ranked Leaderboards with MongoDB Aggregation Framework](/blog/making-ranked-leaderboards-with-mongodb-aggregation-framework) was about a database work that I was glad to solve for Toph and share with the world.

All of my blog posts under this challenge are tagged with [#100DaysToOffload](/tags/100daystooffload/).

## What are you planning to write about next?

Almost everything I have written so far is from things that I needed to know or learn at different junctures of work.

I suspect what's next will depend a lot on what I am doing every day.

Perhaps this is where I could improve my workflow a bit and start maintaining a list of things that I want to eventually write about.

## Why choose the 34th post as a milestone?

Because:

<center><span class="math -block">\lceil 100 \div 3 \times i \rceil \enspace \textcolor{grey}{\texttt{and}} \enspace i = 1, 2, 3</span></center>

That way, I will be posting another milestone post at 67 and then finally at 100 in sha Allah.
