You have a few options to add social network sharing buttons to your website or web app.

One, you can embed their JavaScript ~~operating systems~~ SDKs. If your site needs 21st-century Internet bloat, this is what you are looking for.

Two, you can use third-party share button JavaScript libraries. There are way too many of these out there. And they are just a `google` away. I will refrain from linking to any.

But if you know me, I prefer lean solutions. And nothing beats using simple anchor elements with links to social network share dialogs. This is the approach I took in [Toph](https://toph.co) and other websites I have built.

In this post, I am sharing a list of links to share dialogs for various social network websites:

- **Facebook**: `https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u={url}` ([Example](https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2F))
- **Twitter**: `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text={text}&url={url}` ([Example](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Mahmud%20Ridwan%20%28hjr265%29&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2F))
- **LinkedIn**: `https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url={url}&title={text}` ([Example](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2F&title=Mahmud%20Ridwan%20%28hjr265%29))
- **Telegram**: `https://telegram.me/share/url?text={text}&url={url}` ([Example](https://telegram.me/share/url?text=Mahmud%20Ridwan%20%28hjr265%29&url=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2F))
