You have a few options to add social network sharing buttons to your website or web app.

One, you can embed their JavaScript ~~operating systems~~ SDKs. If your site needs 21st-century Internet bloat, this is what you are looking for.

Two, you can use third-party share button JavaScript libraries. There are way too many of these out there. And they are just a "google" away. I will refrain from linking to any.

But if you know me, I prefer lean solutions. And nothing beats using simple anchor elements with links to social network share dialogs. This is the approach I took in [Toph](https://toph.co) and other websites I have built.

In this post, I am sharing a list of links to share dialogs for various social network websites:

- **Facebook**: `https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u={url}`
- **Twitter**: `https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text={text}&url={url}`
- **LinkedIn**: `https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url={url}&title={text}`
- **Telegram**: `https://telegram.me/share/url?text={text}&url={url}`

Example:

<div>

    <a href="https://facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2Fblog%2Flinks-for-social-network-share-dialogs%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="facebook.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 0.25rem; width: 2rem;"></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet/?text=Links%20for%20Social%20Network%20Share%20Dialogs&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2Fblog%2Flinks-for-social-network-share-dialogs%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="twitter.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 0.25rem; width: 2rem;"></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2Fblog%2Flinks-for-social-network-share-dialogs%2F&amp;title=Links%20for%20Social%20Network%20Share%20Dialogs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="linkedin.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 0.25rem; width: 2rem;"></a> <a href="https://telegram.me/share/url?text=Links%20for%20Social%20Network%20Share%20Dialogs&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhjr265.me%2Fblog%2Flinks-for-social-network-share-dialogs%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="telegram.png" alt="" style="border-radius: 0.25rem; width: 2rem;"></a>
