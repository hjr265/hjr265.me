It is my second milestone blog post of the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge. I posted my [first milestone blog post](/blog/100daystooffload-milestone-34th-blog-post/) on September 3, 2023.

I will keep this one short.

But I will say that I have posted as many [#100DaysToOffload blog posts](/tags/100daystooffload/) in the last 43 days as I have since I started the challenge.

It is probably a remnant characteristic of my days in the university. Something I should work on changing. Maybe I will get to this after I finish this challenge.

Some of these posts, again, did pretty well on the Internet.

- [Adding Icons for Go-built Windows Executable](/blog/adding-icons-for-go-built-windows-executable/) got picked up by some programming newsletters and gained good traction.
- [Hiding Files in ZIP Archives](/blog/hiding-files-in-zip-archives/) was my first blog post on steganography.
- [Making an Auto Scroll Bookmarklet](/blog/making-an-auto-scroll-bookmarklet/) was about bookmarklets, which I think is mostly forgotten by now, but was such a neat way to build functionalities into web browsers. 

I have tagged all my blog posts under this challenge with [#100DaysToOffload](/tags/100daystooffload/).

Now, I need to write 33 more blog posts in 41 days.
