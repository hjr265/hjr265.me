I started Furqan Software in 2015 because I wanted to build software that lasts. Named “Furqan” (فرقان /fʊrˈkɑːn/, “criterion”), the company reflects a commitment to clear architecture, honest communication, and practical craftsmanship so clients get reliable, maintainable solutions that grow with them.
