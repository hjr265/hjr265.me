CodeMarshal is a programming contest hosting platform. The platform successfully hosted the preliminary mock, preliminary, live, and semi-live contests of ACM ICPC 2014 Dhaka Regional.

I built CodeMarshal while employed at Mukto Software Ltd. under the leadership of then Chairman and CEO Mahmudur Rahman.
