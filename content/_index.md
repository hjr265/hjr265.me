Hi, Iâ€™m Mahmud Ridwan, a software engineer based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I began [my career](/experience/) in 2010 as a software developer. I earned my B.Sc. in Computer Science in late 2012, during which I developed a passion for competitive programming.

In 2015, I founded [Furqan Software](https://furqansoftware.com/) and transformed my pet project into [Toph](https://toph.co/), which has since become the leading competitive programming platform in Bangladesh.

Additionally, I work through networks like Toptal as a freelance software engineer, allowing me to collaborate on diverse projects.

I have a strong affinity for <dfn title="as in freedom">free</dfn> software and take great pleasure in creating [open-source software](/open-source/).
